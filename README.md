## Project Description

The is a landing page project used as practice for HTML and CSS, all page layout styling was done using flexbox.

## Reflection

I struggled with placing my content where I wanted them to be at first. Flexbox wasn't behaving how I intended them to be but what helped me was drawing borders around containers so I could visually see each box. After this I had an easier time placing my content correctly.
